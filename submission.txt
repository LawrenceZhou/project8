Project #8 - Submission form

Enter no more than 5 user stories that you did for the assignment that you would like to be
graded on. For each story include the following information:

Story points:  4  4  3 
Brief description to see the story in action:
Deleting and Like are intuitive as you can easily take actions. As for 8 - Sidebar list marks users with new activity, I didn’t complete it. But I mark it clear who is the current user.

Total Story Points: 11

Marketing Video URL (ensure permissions are set to public viewing):

Is it OK with you if we post your Marketing Video URL on the class discussion forum?
Yes!

Any special instructions for Grading (should be easy to run app from new machine):
Well, I spent a lot of time on UI design. I like the buttons part of my website, which have a dynamic border(hard to achieve). In addition, it’s interesting to have a collage preview of one user’s photos. You can try it, by clicking into one user’s detail page several times! It’s randomly generated! Anyway, I didn’t finish all 12 points, but spent too much time on UI design, which is not a good idea but still interesting to do!
